       "{'TSLA': [' In this article Apple and Tesla are facing major headwinds in China which is contributing to investor jitters around the two U.S. technology giants. Tesla shares tanked 12% on Tuesday after the electric car maker reported deliveries that fell short of analyst expectations, while Apple dropped more than 3% as concerns resurfaced about demand for the company\\'s flagship iPhone in the December quarter. Challenges in China are partly behind the stock falls. The world\\'s second-largest economy accounts for around 17% of Apple\\'s sales and 23% of Tesla\\'s revenue, making it a significant market for both American companies. \"China is the hearts and lungs of both demand and supply for both Apple and Tesla. The biggest worry for the Street is that the China economy and consumer are reining in spending and this is an ominous sign\" for Apple and Tesla, Daniel Ives, senior equity analyst at Wedbush Securities, told CNBC. \"In 2022 the worry was supply chain issues and zero Covid related issues, 2023 is the demand worries and this has cast a major overhang on both Apple and Tesla which heavily rely on the Chinese consumer.\" For Apple, investors have one eye on the company\\'s fiscal first-quarter results likely to be released later this month which cover the crucial December holiday period. But in October, the world\\'s biggest iPhone factory in Zhengzhou, China, was hit with a Covid outbreak. Taiwanese company Foxconn, which runs the plant, imposed restrictions. In November, the factory was rocked by worker protests over a pay dispute with many employees walking out. Foxconn has attempted to entice workers back with bonuses. Reuters reported Tuesday that Foxconn\\'s Zhengzhou factory is almost back to full production. The episode highlighted Apple\\'s reliance on China for iPhone production. In early November, after Foxconn imposed Covid restrictions at the factory, Apple said the plant was operating at a \"significantly reduced capacity.\" Analysts at Evercore ISI estimate a $5 billion to $8 billion revenue shortfall for Apple in the December quarter. Apple could report a 1% annual decline in revenue in the December quarter, according to Refinitiv consensus estimates. That',\n",
       "  'Elon Musk’s misadventure with Twitter is not the main factor in the dramatic decline in value Only part of the plunge in Tesla’s stock market value can be pinned on Elon Musk’s misadventure with Twitter. Yes, selling a few tens of billions of dollars-worth of Tesla stock – far more than he signalled at the outset – to fund the purchase was bound to dampen the mood among investors in the back seat. And, yes, the distraction factor is serious; Tesla’s non-executive directors should be screaming at the boss to get back to the day job. But the main cause of Tesla’s decline from a $1.2tn valuation to today’s £350bn is surely very simple: the stock was ludicrously overpriced in the first place. Investors were required to believe that revenues could keep rocketing for years and competitors’ attempts to catch up with electric vehicles would barely affect Tesla’s profit margins. If such a plotline seemed unlikely, Jeremy Grantham, British co-founder of Boston-based fund manager GMO and a student of stock market bubbles, offered a recent historical perspective a year ago to explain exactly how far-fetched it was. Tesla was being valued at “many multiples” of the price-to-sales ratios that had been achieved by members of the big-tech Faang club at the same stage of their corporate development, he pointed out. The market was assuming Musk’s creation would not only be as brilliantly successful as the likes of Facebook, Apple, Amazon, Netflix and Google – “some of the greatest companies in the history of capitalism” – its success would put theirs in the shade. “This is a big ask,” Grantham said drily. You bet. Thus the stock market’s savage reaction this week to a miss by Tesla to its revenue targets makes perfect sense. The shortfall in sales wasn’t enormous and a growth rate of 40% for 2022 is still slick but, if 50% until eternity had been previously been assumed, the difference matters. It is evidence that competitors are already more than a minor irritant. The day was bound to arrive. It was always absurd to ignore the well-funded efforts',\n",

       " 'INTC': [\"Intel (INTC) is hitting CES 2023 with some serious swagger, announcing a new line of mobile processors including what it says is the world’s fastest chip for a laptop. The company’s 13th-generation Intel Core chips range from the high-end HX series to the entry-level N series, and will land in consumer laptops from a slew of manufacturers later this year. At the top of the spectrum is Intel’s Core i9-13980HX chip. Packing a whopping 24 cores, a first for a laptop, including 8 performance cores for heavy duty tasks like gaming and 14 efficiency cores for mundane activities like web browsing, the top of the line HX can reach peak speeds of 5.6GHz. That’s wildly fast for a processor, and, in most cases, unnecessary for the large majority of consumers. Of course, that's only the chip’s performance cores and only when pushed to their limits. Otherwise, they’ll run at 2.2GHz. To put that in perspective, Apple’s (AAPL) M1 Max, the company’s most powerful chip, reaches clock speeds of 3.2GHz, according to Anandtech. Outside of its high speeds, the HX is compatible with up to 128GB of RAM, an absurd number that gamers and professionals in need of hardcore performance will love to see. Don’t expect laptops equipped with the HX chip to be cheap, though. These processors will end up in only the priciest laptops around. “The 13th-generation Intel Core mobile processor family delivers unrivaled, scalable performance for leadership platforms across all laptop segments,” Michelle Johnston Holthaus, executive vice president and general manager of Intel’s Client Computing Group, said in a statement. “With our industry-leading technologies and unmatched global partner ecosystem, people can expect a high-caliber mobile experience in new and unique form factors so they can game or create from anywhere.” In addition to the HX series of chips, Intel also rolled out its new 13th-generation Core P and Core U series processors. Those chips are meant for more mainstream laptops that will find their way into the majority of consumers’ homes. The Core P and Core U processors feature 14 cores, 6 for performance and 8 for efficiency.\",\n",

       "  \"Intel (INTC) closed the most recent trading day at $26.73, moving +1.14% from the previous trading session. The stock outpaced the S&P 500's daily loss of 0.4%. Meanwhile, the Dow lost 0.03%, and the Nasdaq, a tech-heavy index, lost 4.72%. Prior to today's trading, shares of the world's largest chipmaker had lost 9.39% over the past month. This has lagged the Computer and Technology sector's loss of 8.46% and the S&P 500's loss of 5.57% in that time. Intel will be looking to display strength as it nears its next earnings release. The company is expected to report EPS of $0.20, down 81.65% from the prior-year quarter. Our most recent consensus estimate is calling for quarterly revenue of $14.5 billion, down 25.76% from the year-ago period. It is also important to note the recent changes to analyst estimates for Intel. These revisions help to show the ever-changing nature of near-term business trends. As a result, we can interpret positive estimate revisions as a good sign for the company's business outlook. Research indicates that these estimate revisions are directly correlated with near-term share price momentum. We developed the Zacks Rank to capitalize on this phenomenon. Our system takes these estimate changes into account and delivers a clear, actionable rating model. Ranging from #1 (Strong Buy) to #5 (Strong Sell), the Zacks Rank system has a proven, outside-audited track record of outperformance, with #1 stocks returning an average of +25% annually since 1988. Within the past 30 days, our consensus EPS projection has moved 1.2% lower. Intel is holding a Zacks Rank of #4 (Sell) right now. Digging into valuation, Intel currently has a Forward P/E ratio of 13.52. Its industry sports an average Forward P/E of 13.52, so we one might conclude that Intel is trading at a no noticeable deviation comparatively. Investors should also note that INTC has a PEG ratio of 1.8 right now. The PEG ratio is similar to the widely-used P/E ratio, but this metric also takes the company's expected earnings growth rate into account.

       " 'AMZN': ['If Tuesday was any indication of how the market will behave this year, then buckle up, it looks like it will be a wild one. The Dow Jones Industrial Average \\n        DJIA\\n       had a 537-point trading range, even though the blue chip index lost only 11 points by the close. It’s still early enough in the year to look at 2023 predictions, so this time we’ll go with one from an analyst who called the market correctly at the end of 2021. “The S&P 500 will have its worst year since 2008,” said Michael Batnick, managing partner at Ritholtz Wealth Management. “I predict this year it will fall more than 15%. The combination of high multiples, high inflation, supply chain issues, and the Fed raising interest rates will prove to be too much for investors to handle.” The S&P 500 \\n        SPX\\n       dropped 19% last year. Of course, not all his predictions came true — for instance, he said the Fed would end up cutting rates by the end of the year — but still that’s a better track record than many. So what does he expect for 2023? Jeff Bezos, in the style of Bob Iger at Walt Disney, will come back to lead Amazon.com \\n        AMZN\\n       after the stock’s 50% drop last year, he reckons. “Jeff Bezos spent 27 years at Amazon and has been gone for less than two. In 2023 he pulls a Bob Iger and returns to steady the ship,” says Batnick. That’s not crazy talk, given Amazon’s share-price struggles, though of course Andy Jassy had the unfortunate timing to start as CEO just five months before the first vaccines arrived, releasing consumers from their homes. “Is Amazon in a lousy business or do they do a lousy job running it,” asked Laura Martin, an analyst at Needham, in a late December note forecasting just 2%',\n",
       "  ' In this article Amazon said Wednesday it will cut over 18,000 jobs, a bigger number than the e-retailer initially said it would be eliminating last year. The Wall Street Journal reported on the cuts earlier, which Amazon said preempted its planned announcement. \"We typically wait to communicate about these outcomes until we can speak with the people who are directly impacted,\" CEO Andy Jassy wrote in a memo to employees that the company published on its blog. \"However, because one of our teammates leaked this information externally, we decided it was better to share this news earlier so you can hear the details directly from me.\" Tech companies are picking up in 2023 where they left off last year, preparing for an extended economic downturn. Salesforce said on Wednesday it would reduce headcount by 10%, impacting over 7,000 employees. Both Amazon and Salesforce admitted that they hired too rapidly during the pandemic. Amazon specifically acknowledged that it had added workers too quickly in warehouses as consumers shifted to online ordering. The company employed 1.54 million people at the end of the third quarter.  In November, Jassy said Amazon would eliminate roles, including at its physical stores and in its devices and books divisions. CNBC reported at the time that Amazon was looking to lay off around 10,000 of its employees. Now the number is higher. \"Amazon has weathered uncertain and difficult economies in the past, and we will continue to do so,\" Jassy wrote. \"These changes will help us pursue our long-term opportunities with a stronger cost structure; however, I\\'m also optimistic that we\\'ll be inventive, resourceful, and scrappy in this time when we\\'re not hiring expansively and eliminating some roles.\" Amazon plans to inform employees who will lose their jobs starting Jan. 18, Jassy wrote, noting that most cuts will come in the stores and People, Experience, and Technology (PXT) groups.

       "  'Amazon aims to shed more than 18,000 roles as it cuts costs, the technology giant\\'s boss says. He added the announcement was brought forward \"because one of our teammates leaked this information externally\". The job cuts amount to around 6% of the company\\'s roughly 300,000-strong corporate workforce. Amazon is the latest big technology firm to unveil major layoffs as the cost of living crisis sees customers cut back on spending. \"We are working to support those who are affected and are providing packages that include a separation payment, transitional health insurance benefits, and external job placement support,\" Amazon\\'s chief executive Andy Jassy said in a message to staff. The move comes after the technology giant said last year that it would reduce its headcount without putting a figure on how many jobs would be cut. Mr Jassy did not specify where affected employees were located, but he said the firm would communicate with organisations that represent employees \"where applicable in Europe\". He also said the \"majority of role eliminations\" would be in the Amazon Stores operations and its People, Experience, and Technology team. In November Amazon said it was starting a round of layoffs as it focused on reducing expenses but did not give a figure of how many jobs it would cut. At the time US media reported that the company would shed around 10,000 roles. The firm had already introduced a hiring freeze and halted some of its warehouse expansions, warning it had over-hired during the pandemic.  It has also taken steps to shut some parts of its business, cancelling projects such as a personal delivery robot. Mr Jassy said in the note that reviewing Amazon\\'s business \"has been more difficult given the uncertain economy and that we\\'ve hired rapidly over the last several years.\" \"Companies that last a long time go through different phases. They\\'re not in heavy people expansion mode every year,\" he added. Times continue to be tough for US Big Tech - Amazon is the latest in a string of giants to announce layoffs in recent months.

       "  'Jan 3 (Reuters) - Amazon.com Inc (AMZN.O) said on Tuesday it had reached an agreement with certain lenders to provide the e-commerce giant an $8 billion unsecured loan. The term loan will mature in 364 days, with an option to extend for another 364 days and the proceeds would be used for general corporate purposes. \"Given the uncertain macroeconomic environment, over the last few months we have used different financing options to support capital expenditures, debt repayments, acquisitions, and working capital needs,\" an Amazon spokesperson told Reuters in a statement. The online retailer has been bracing for likely slower growth, as soaring inflation forces businesses and consumers to cut back spending. That, coupled with a strong greenback, dragged Amazon\\'s shares about 50% lower in 2022. It had also flagged workforce reductions in early 2023, without specifying the number. A source told Reuters in November that the company was targeting about 10,000 job cuts. Amazon had about $35 billion in cash and cash equivalents and long-term debt of about $59 billion at the end of the third quarter ended Sept. 30.

       "  'Nvidia (NVDA) rolled into CES 2023 with a slew of major announcements on Tuesday including news that it is teaming up with Foxconn, which will begin manufacturing electric vehicles based on Nvidia’s Drive Hyperion platform. The company also announced new graphics chips for laptops and improvements to its GeForce Now game streaming platform. The automotive news doesn’t mean that Nvidia is getting into building vehicles themselves. Rather, Foxconn, which is expanding its manufacturing capabilities into building electric vehicles for third-party automakers such as Lordstown Motors, will use Nvidia’s Drive Hyperion platform to build cars. Drive Hyperion is a reference and development that consists of a suite of software and hardware meant to help automakers speed up the production of autonomous vehicles. “Our partnership with Foxconn will provide OEMs developing intelligent driving solutions with a world-class supplier that can scale for volume manufacturing of the Nvidia Drive Orin platform,” Rishi Dhall, vice president of automotive at Nvidia, said in a statement. “Foxconn’s decision to also use the Drive Hyperion sensor suite for its EVs will help accelerate their path to production without compromising safety, reliability or quality,” Dhall added. Nvidia has been increasingly diving into the automotive market by building out the sensors and software automakers will need to ensure their vehicles can eventually navigate the world without the need for driver intervention. The company’s automotive efforts, however, still make up a small amount of its overall revenue. Of Nvidia’s $5.93 billion in revenue in Q3, the automotive group pulled in just $251 million. Its gaming and data center businesses, meanwhile, raked in $1.57 billion and $3.83 billion, respectively. Outside of its deal with Foxconn, Nvidia also debuted its latest laptop graphics chips ranging from the entry-level RTX 4050 chip to the high-end RTX 4090 card. According to the company, laptops running on RTX 40 series chips should offer up to four times the performance in games like “Cyberpunk 2077,” while providing three times the energy efficiency of Nvidia’s prior generation chips. If you’re hoping to get your hands on a laptop running an RTX 4080 or RTX 4090, though, you’ll',\n",
